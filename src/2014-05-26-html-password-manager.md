===========================================================================

If you spend a lot of time online, and since you even managed to end up on this page, I’m assuming you do, you’ve surely had this problem before: a freaking gazillion usernames and passwords to keep track of. Sure there’s a remember password option in most browsers, and sure there are browser extensions like RoboForm and stand-alone password managers like KeePassX, but wouldn’t it be nice to have a simple, regular text file … with a search option … maybe even view it in a browser, since you’re already there? I thought it would be awesome, so I came up with this little HTML file:



Everything’s there: CSS, JavaScript, even the favicon – all embedded. There’s no copy to clipboard option, since JavaScript doesn’t allow that, but you do get a one-click-select-text feature and a left Alt query reset. Ok, I’ll shut up now. Just try the DEMO if you’re not convinced.
